## Idea for short paper

"Using multiple alignment analyses to automatically extract dialect maps from dialect data"

* align pad data automatically, using defaults (lib_align)
* correct the data manually (two aligners, same files)
* check for annotators agreement

## Preliminary workflow

* align data automatically
* (apply manual correction)
* use one language as reference (High German)
* align this language to the rest of the data (manually or automatically)
* create system to plot a given MSA on geographic maps

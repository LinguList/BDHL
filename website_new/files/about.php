<h2>About the BDPA</h2>
<br><br>

With the "Benchmark Database for Phonetic Alignments" (BDPA), we present a new data resource for historical linguistics and dialectology which offers collections of cognate words from different language varieties. In contrast to other resources which concentrate on questions of cognacy and lexical change, the BDPA represents the data in form of pairwise and multiple <i>alignments</i>. An alignment is a matrix representation of two or more sequences in which corresponding segments in the sequences are placed in the same column, with empty cells resulting from non-matching segments being filled by <i>gap</i> symbols. <br><br>
Currently, the BDPA offers a total of 750 multiple alignments, covering eight language families, more than 500 different linguistic varietie, and more than 50 000 words.

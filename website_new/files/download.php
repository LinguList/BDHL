<h3>Download the Data of the BDPA</h3>
<br>
The phonetic alignment data is available in form of specific text-based alignment formats for pairwise and multiple alignments.
A closer description of the formats we use can be found <a href="faq.php#formats">here</a>.
<br><br>
<h3>Pairwise Phonetic Alignment Benchmark</h3><br>
For pairwise alignments, we offer three different benchmarks:<br><br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://lingulist.de/evobib/evobib.php?key=Covington1996">Covington's (1996)</a> original benchmark dataset, </li>
<li> our master benchmark containing the most diverse 7126 sequence pairs automatically chosen from our multiple alignment benchmark in two flavors, as <i>global</i> and <i>local</i> alignments </li>
<li> a benchmark containing a selection of the most diverse 1089 sequence pairs automatically drawn from those languages in our multiple alignment benchmark that are <i>tone</i> languages, again, both in a <i>global</i> and in a <i>local</i> variant.
</ul>

<h3>Multiple Phonetic Alignments</h3><br>
For multiple alignments, we offer a large master dataset of 750 files. 
This masterset can be subdivided into several small datasets according to different criteria, such as
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> the language family from which the data is taken, or </li>
<li> the diversity of the phonetic sequences that occur in the alignments. </li>
</ul>
